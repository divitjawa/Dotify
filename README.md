# Dotify by Divit Jawa

This is the second part of the app building process where we add some functionality to the a. It has some basic functionality in it right now.

I have completed all extra credit questions.



This part adds some functionality where you can choose a song from the list, and it displays the name and artist on the mini player. You can also shuffle the song. Additionally, when you click on the mini player, the music player is launched.
